# Keep Learning Coding

Thanks for attending the workshop. We hope you had a great time and have caught the coding bug.

Here are some reasources you can use to teach yourself more coding skills

## General
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) A great free site with lots of tutorials covering html, css, javascript and more. Great paid sites include [Treehouse](teamtreehouse.com) and [Lynda] (lynda.com).


### Responsive Design with Bootstrap
Responsive design is all about making sites look good on any sized device.
A great tool for responsive design is [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Twitter bootstrap is a css and javascript library for building responsive sites. A good place to start learning this is the Codecademy [Make a website course](https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-a-website) which has a section on [adding Bootstrap] (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-yjvdd/0/1)

### Javascript
Javascript is used to add animation, and behaviour to sites, and much more. Checkout out the [Codecademy Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript). Once you have completed this course you might fancy trying your hand at some of the [Codewars Kata Problems] (http://www.codewars.com), they are designed to be difficult you will learn loads.

### Founders & Coders Meetups
Keep an eye out on our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/) for more weekend workshops coming soon. Founders & Coders also run weekly Coding for Everyone workshops, and fortnightly Coding for Women workshops, which are free and provide a less structured learning environment. If you are really keen you might be interested in our 16 Week free coding workshop, checkout out [Fouders & Coders] (http://www.foundersandcoders.com/academy/#apply).

You can also join the [Founders & Coders Coding for Everyone gitter channel](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone).

I think html is an easier topic than CSS, so perhaps we should do html and a tiny bit of CSS in the morning - and leave the afternoon for the more meaty (and annoying) CSS topics like position etc.


###start

10-15 mins settling time with materials and GitHub repo on board.
Students need to make sure they have:
- Text editor (Atom or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)) down load if 
- https://github.com/foundersandcoders/workshop-html-css


## Intro to FAC
1. Task - Html sort card tasks
    * Tags: html, head, title, body, h1, h2, p, footer.
2. Talk 
    -    What HTML, CSS & JS are for (skeleton, clothes, movement)
    -    Static sites - what they are, what they are used for
    -    structure of the day, what we will achieve
    
3. Talk : html basics
    * What tags look like - open, closing and self closing.
    * html attributes, suchas class, id's, src, alt....
    * How tags contain other tags - touch on parent child relationship and indentation. 
    * What head and body tags are, and what's contained in them. 

4. Task : html basic
    * Display tags from html sort task
    * Students have to pair to create a page which uses all of them
    * Introduce W3 schools (show MDN at end of course - I think its more confusing than w3 to complete beginners)
    * Introduce googling as a skill
        * http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp

5. Feedback - get a student to demo work
6. Explanation - images - walk students through how to create an image folder and save an image
    * Task - students use W3 schools to work out how to load an image from another server.

###Easy intro to  CSS
* Introduce CSS for style
    1. Task : attach a CSS Style sheet and change text color using html selector. Walk through this quickly then get them to do in pairs.
    - Intro what css selectors are:- class, id, tag names.
    - extentions try hex, rgb and named colours - W3 reference
